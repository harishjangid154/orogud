  "content": "<h2>Why Amla Candy Is Ayurveda’s Tastiest Rasayana</h2>\n<p>Amla (Indian gooseberry) is celebrated in Ayurveda as one of the most potent Rasayana fruits. When turned into candy using jaggery, it becomes a delicious, functional snack loved by both adults and children.</p>\n\n<h2>How Amla Candy Is Made</h2>\n<p>Fresh Amla is sliced, deseeded, and slow-dried using sun-drying or low-heat dehydration. Once dried, it is mixed with warm jaggery syrup that coats the pieces naturally and preserves them without chemicals. This method maintains Amla’s vitamin C content and its signature sweet–sour taste.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of Eating Amla Candy</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immunity Boost:</strong> Amla is one of the richest natural sources of Vitamin C.</li>\n<li><strong>Digestive Support:</strong> Acts as a natural after-meal digestive.</li>\n<li><strong>Hair & Skin Health:</strong> Promotes collagen and tissue repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Kid-Friendly:</strong> A healthy alternative to sugar candy.</li>\n<li><strong>Travel-Safe:</strong> Easy to carry and enjoy anywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Amla Candy Daily</h2>\n<p>Have 2–4 pieces after meals or as a mid-day snack. It is especially helpful during seasonal changes when immunity may dip.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Those managing diabetes should consult a doctor before regular use.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop organic Amla candy</a> and enjoy daily sweet nourishment.</p>",
