  "content": "<h2>Why Ayurveda Reveres Arjuna</h2>\n<p>Terminalia arjuna is celebrated as a heart-supportive herb in classical Ayurvedic literature. Traditionally, it supports strength, circulation, and emotional steadiness, making it a cornerstone of many cardiac herbal blends.</p>\n\n<h2>What Modern Research Suggests</h2>\n<p>Studies indicate Arjuna may support normal cardiac function and antioxidant activity. However, it should be viewed as complementary—not a replacement for medical treatment.</p>\n\n<h2>Safe Use Matters</h2>\n<p>Because heart health is sensitive, Arjuna-based supplements must be used cautiously. Always consult a physician, especially if you’re on medication for blood pressure, arrhythmia, or cholesterol.</p>\n\n<h2>Integrative Heart Lifestyle Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Practice slow, deep breathing for 5–10 minutes daily.</li>\n<li>Favor warm, grounding foods with minimal stimulants.</li>\n<li>Incorporate gentle walking and yoga.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Arjuna Heart Tonic</a> — always with practitioner guidance.</p>"
