Ayurvedic energy bars, however, use whole ingredients like dates, nuts, ghee, and spices to provide clean, stable energy.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Dates + Makhana + Ghee</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Natural energy and iron-rich sweetness.</li>\n<li><strong>Makhana:</strong> Light, nutrient-dense, Vata-balancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Ghee:</strong> Supports digestion and sustained energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Almonds:</strong> Healthy fats and protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardamom:</strong> Aids digestion and adds aroma.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Perfect for Active Lifestyles</h2>\n<p>These bars provide the right balance of carbohydrates, minerals, and healthy fats. They are excellent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre/post yoga</li>\n<li>As a mid-day work snack</li>\n<li>For children needing natural energy</li>\n<li>During travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Storage & Freshness</h2>\n<p>Store in a cool, dry place. Because these bars contain ghee and natural ingredients, they stay fresh for 30–45 days without refrigeration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> People with diabetes should consult their doctor before consuming date-based snacks.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Ayurvedic Energy Bars</a> and energize your day naturally.</p>"
