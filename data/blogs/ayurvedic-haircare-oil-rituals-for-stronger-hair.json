  "content": "<h2>The Ayurvedic Foundation of Oil Oiling</h2>\n<p>Hair oiling (Abhyanga for the scalp) is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic personal care. Using medicated oils nourishes the scalp, improves circulation to hair roots, and supports overall hair quality. Bhringraj and amla are two herbs historically used to maintain hair vitality and color.</p>\n\n<h2>How Bhringraj and Amla Work Together</h2>\n<p>Bhringraj calms the scalp and supports follicle health, while amla supplies potent antioxidants and vitamin C that strengthen hair fibers and support pigment. When infused into a nourishing oil base—coconut or sesame—the combination becomes an effective tonic for regular use.</p>\n\n<h2>Simple Scalp Oiling Routine</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Warm 1–2 tsp oil to lukewarm temperature.</li>\n<li>Part hair and apply oil directly to the scalp using the applicator nozzle.</li>\n<li>Massage gently for 5–10 minutes to stimulate circulation.</li>\n<li>Leave for 1–2 hours or overnight for deep nourishment.</li>\n<li>Shampoo gently and condition as usual.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat 1–2 times a week for maintenance; increase frequency for seasonal dryness or Vata imbalance.</p>\n\n<h2>Precautions & When to Consult a Specialist</h2>\n<p>If you experience sudden, patchy hair loss, severe itching, or inflamed scalp, seek advice from a trichologist or Ayurvedic practitioner to rule out underlying causes. Patch-test before use to avoid allergic reactions.</p>\n\n<h2>Choose Quality Oils & Herbs</h2>\n<p>Prefer cold-pressed oil bases and organic herb infusions. Avoid synthetic fragrances and preservatives that may irritate the scalp.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop herbal hair oil</a> and start a weekly ritual for stronger, shinier hair.</p>",
