It stimulates digestion, calms the stomach, and can reduce the sensation of nausea. In travel settings, a small amount of ginger often prevents motion-related queasiness.</p>\n\n<h2>Mint: Cooling & Soothing</h2>\n<p>Mint soothes the head and stomach. When combined with ginger, it provides balanced relief—warming support internally and cooling relief for the head.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Herbal Lozenges</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Suck a lozenge slowly at the first sign of queasiness.</li>\n<li>Take another after 30–60 minutes if needed, following dosing guidance.</li>\n<li>Use alongside simple practices like focused breathing and looking at the horizon while traveling.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>\n<p>If nausea is severe, persistent, accompanied by fever, vomiting, or dehydration, seek medical attention. Lozenges are supportive but not a replacement for urgent care when symptoms are serious.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Anti-Nausea Lozenges</a> — gentle relief for travel and daily queasiness.</p>",
