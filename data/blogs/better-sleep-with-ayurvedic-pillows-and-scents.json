Ayurveda pairs aromatic nervous-system tonics (like jatamansi) with supporting rituals to re-establish natural rhythm.</p>\n\n<h2>Lavender & Jatamansi: A Calming Pair</h2>\n<p><strong>Lavender</strong> is widely known for its relaxing effect and gentle anxiolytic properties. <strong>Jatamansi</strong> (spikenard) is a classical Ayurvedic nervine that calms Vata and supports deep, restful sleep. Together they create a layered, calming aroma conducive to falling asleep.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use a Sleep Pillow Effectively</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Place the pillow under the neck or across closed eyes during pre-sleep relaxation.</li>\n<li>Combine with a short breath practice (5–10 minutes of slow diaphragmatic breathing).</li>\n<li>Refresh the inner herb sachet every 3–6 months to maintain aroma strength.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Safety & Practical Tips</h2>\n<p>Test the scent before full-night use if you have fragrance sensitivity. Avoid using intensely strong aromas if you have asthma or severe allergies. Do not leave pillows on infants or unsupervised children.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Ayurvedic Sleep Pillow</a> and add a gentle scent ritual to your nighttime routine.</p>"
