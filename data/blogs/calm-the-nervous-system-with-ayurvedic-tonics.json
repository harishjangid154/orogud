Nervine herbs nourish, ground, and stabilize the mind-body connection.</p>\n\n<h2>Top Nervine Herbs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jatamansi:</strong> Deeply calming and grounding.</li>\n<li><strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> Adaptogenic, strengthening, restorative.</li>\n<li><strong>Brahmi:</strong> Supports clarity, cognition, and calm prana.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Best Times to Use Nerve Tonics</h2>\n<p>Evenings are ideal, when the nervous system naturally transitions into a slower state. Pair them with light stretching, warm baths, or herbal teas.</p>\n\n<h2>Lifestyle Support</h2>\n<p>Reduce caffeine, maintain consistent sleep times, and include warm, grounding foods like khichdi and ghee for deeper nourishment.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Nerve Tonic</a> to support calmness naturally.</p>"
