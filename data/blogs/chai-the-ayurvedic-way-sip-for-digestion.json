Cardamom cools and opens the senses, ginger boosts warmth, cinnamon stabilizes blood sugar, pepper enhances absorption, and clove uplifts metabolism.</p>\n\n<h2>Why These Spices Work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cardamom:</strong> Aromatic, digestive, and gentle on the stomach.</li>\n<li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Warming root that activates sluggish digestion.</li>\n<li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Enhances circulation and helps balance sugar.</li>\n<li><strong>Black Pepper:</strong> Boosts absorption and clears channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Clove:</strong> Stimulates warmth and respiratory comfort.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Brew Chai the Ayurvedic Way</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Boil water with 1 tsp chai mix per cup.</li>\n<li>Add milk or plant milk and simmer for 3–5 minutes.</li>\n<li>Sweeten with jaggery or honey (after cooling slightly).</li>\n<li>Sip mindfully while warm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Chai for Different Doshas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kapha:</strong> Ideal—warming and stimulating.</li>\n<li><strong>Vata:</strong> Add more milk or a touch of ghee for grounding.</li>\n<li><strong>Pitta:</strong> Reduce ginger/pepper or brew lightly to avoid excess heat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Daily Ritual Value</h2>\n<p>A warm cup of chai after meals can ease heaviness, reduce gas, and support respiratory comfort. It’s also a comforting ritual that pairs beautifully with reading, journaling, or meditation.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Cardamom & Ginger Chai Mix</a> and turn your daily cup into a wellness ritual.</p>"
