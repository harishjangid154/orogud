Ayurveda evaluates oils not just by nutrition but by their \"guna\"—heaviness, warmth, stability, and effect on doshas.</p>\n\n<h2>Sesame + Rice Bran: A Smart Daily Choice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sesame:</strong> Warm, nourishing, ideal for Vata.</li>\n<li><strong>Rice Bran:</strong> Light, stable, supports Kapha moderation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This blend is perfect for moderate-heat cooking and daily meals.</p>\n\n<h2>Smoke Point Basics</h2>\n<p>Overheating oils leads to breakdown. Always cook below smoke point to preserve freshness and avoid harmful compounds.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Cooking Oil Blend</a> and upgrade your kitchen the Ayurvedic way.</p>"
