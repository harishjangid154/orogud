  "content": "<h2>What Are Classical Mineral Tonics?</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda includes a category of mineral-based preparations used in rasayana and therapeutic contexts. These are not casual supplements—they undergo precise shodhana (purification) and are typically prescribed by trained practitioners.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Professional Guidance Is Essential</h2>\n<p>Mineral preparations can be potent and require correct purification, dosing, and duration. Without proper processing they may be ineffective or even harmful. Always consult an Ayurvedic physician before use.</p>\n\n<h2>Modern Considerations & Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Many people seeking mineral or calcium support benefit from food-based alternatives (dairy, sesame, leafy greens) or clinically studied supplements. For skin and vitality, nutrient-dense Rasayanas like chyawanprash, amla, or targeted herbal formulations can be safer everyday choices.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety & Sourcing</h2>\n<p>If considering classical mineral tonics, verify that the product is professionally prepared, clearly labeled for practitioner use, and accompanied by usage guidance.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Explore Classical Mineral Tonics</a> — with practitioner guidance and careful sourcing.</p>"
