Hydrosols—aromatic waters produced during steam distillation—offer a gentle, alcohol-free way to enjoy botanical scents without irritation.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Lavender + Ashwagandha?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lavender:</strong> Widely known for calming and sleep-supportive effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Ashwagandha hydrosol:</strong> Adds an adaptogenic, grounding undertone to the scent profile.</li>\n<li><strong>Rose water:</strong> Adds cooling, uplifting balance—especially helpful for Pitta.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Anti-Stress Sprays</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Mist the pillow or room a few spritzes before bedtime or meditation.</li>\n<li>Use at your desk to reset focus and calm overwhelm.</li>\n<li>Avoid direct spraying on skin and test fabrics for staining.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Dosha Notes & Precautions</h2>\n<p>Most people tolerate hydrosols well, but those extremely sensitive to fragrances or with respiratory conditions should test cautiously. Pregnant women should consult their caregiver before using new aromatic products.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Anti-Stress Spray</a> and make calm a simple, everyday habit.</p>"
