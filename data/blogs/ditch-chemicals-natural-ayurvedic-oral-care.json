These ingredients cleanse the mouth, strengthen gums, and maintain fresh breath without synthetic foaming agents.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Herbs That Support Oral Health</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neem:</strong> Powerful antimicrobial for gum health.</li>\n<li><strong>Turmeric:</strong> Reduces inflammation and soothes gums.</li>\n<li><strong>Clove:</strong> Strengthens gums and reduces sensitivity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Ayurvedic Tooth Powder</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Wet your brush.</li>\n<li>Dip gently — a little goes a long way.</li>\n<li>Brush for 1–2 minutes.</li>\n<li>Rinse thoroughly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use 2–3 times weekly to avoid abrasiveness.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety Notes</h2>\n<p>Ayurvedic powders are not meant to be swallowed. People with enamel thinning or gum disease should consult a dentist before switching entirely to powders.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop neem & turmeric tooth powder</a> for cleaner, fresher oral hygiene naturally.</p>"
