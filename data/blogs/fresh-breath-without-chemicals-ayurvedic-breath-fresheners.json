Combine with proper tongue cleaning for best results.</p>\n\n<h2>Ayurvedic Oral Hygiene Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Scrape your tongue daily.</li>\n<li>Oil pull several times a week.</li>\n<li>Stay hydrated to reduce dry-mouth odor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Breath Freshener</a> for a cleaner, herbal approach to oral care.</p>"
