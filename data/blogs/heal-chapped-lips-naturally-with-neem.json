  "content": "<h2>Neem: Ayurveda’s Natural Protector</h2>\n<p>Neem is known in Ayurveda as <em>sarva roga nivarini</em>—the herb that removes all disease. Its antimicrobial and cooling properties make it especially effective for chapped, inflamed, or irritated lips caused by heat, dryness, or weather exposure.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Neem Lip Balms Work</h2>\n<p>Most commercial lip balms simply coat the lips, but neem-based balms actively support healing. Neem reduces irritation, beeswax or candelilla creates a natural barrier, cocoa butter nourishes deeply, and vitamin E helps repair damaged skin.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Neem Lip Balm Effectively</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply throughout the day as needed.</li>\n<li>Use at bedtime for overnight repair.</li>\n<li>Pair with hydration and gentle exfoliation for best results.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Natural vs Chemical Balms</h2>\n<p>Natural balms avoid petroleum derivatives that may feel smooth but trap impurities. Herbal balms instead soothe, restore, and allow the skin to breathe.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Neem Lip Balm</a> for cooling, protective care every day.</p>"
