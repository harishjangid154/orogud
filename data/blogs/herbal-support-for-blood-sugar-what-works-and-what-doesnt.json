  "content": "<h2>The Ayurvedic Lens on Blood Sugar</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda frames blood sugar imbalance as a disturbance of Kapha and impaired digestive fire. Herbal support focuses on improving metabolism—not replacing clinical treatment. Herbs complement, but never replace medical monitoring.</p>\n\n<h2>What Actually Helps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fenugreek:</strong> High in fiber and supportive for digestion and metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>Bitter Melon:</strong> Traditionally used to support healthy glucose handling.</li>\n<li><strong>Gymnema:</strong> Known as “sugar destroyer,” helps reduce sugar cravings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What Doesn’t Work</h2>\n<p>Quick fixes, extreme detoxes, or taking herbs without medical supervision. These approaches can be harmful, especially if you're on medication.</p>\n\n<h2>Safe Ayurveda + Lifestyle Practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eat balanced meals with whole grains and fiber.</li>\n<li>Walk lightly after meals to support digestion.</li>\n<li>Prioritize sleep—Glucose control worsens when sleep is disrupted.</li>\n<li>Avoid excessive snacking and refined carbs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Essential Safety Notice</h2>\n<p>If you are on blood-sugar–lowering medication, always check with your doctor before adding herbs. Monitor glucose regularly.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Diabetic Support</a> — safe, supervised Ayurvedic support.</p>",
