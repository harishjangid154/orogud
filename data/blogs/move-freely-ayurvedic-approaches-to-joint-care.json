Ayurveda views these issues as Vata disturbances—dryness, cold, and restricted movement in the joints. The antidote? Warmth, lubrication, and routine nourishment.</p>\n\n<h2>How Herbal Balms Support Joint Comfort</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guggul:</strong> A classical resin used to support circulation and reduce stiffness.</li>\n<li><strong>Mahanarayan Oil:</strong> A traditional blend of herbs infused in sesame oil, known for soothing sore joints and restoring mobility.</li>\n<li><strong>Camphor (small):</strong> Provides calming warmth that helps ease tension and improve blood flow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When these ingredients are combined into a balm, they offer a simple, topical solution that is easy to apply before or after activity.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Joint Balm Effectively</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Warm the area with a hot towel or gentle movement.</li>\n<li>Apply a thin layer of balm over the joint.</li>\n<li>Massage slowly in circular motions to stimulate circulation.</li>\n<li>Cover with a cloth for 10 minutes for enhanced absorption.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Lifestyle Habits That Help Mobility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Daily stretching:</strong> Especially hip openers and spinal twists.</li>\n<li><strong>Warm foods:</strong> Avoid cold, raw meals that aggravate Vata.</li>\n<li><strong>Regular oil massage (Abhyanga):</strong> Sesame oil strengthens and nourishes tissues.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay active:</strong> Even 20 minutes of walking boosts joint lubrication.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When to Seek Medical Care</h2>\n<p>If joint pain is severe, persistent, accompanied by swelling, fever, or limited movement, consult a healthcare provider. Herbal balms support comfort but are not substitutes for diagnosis or treatment.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Joint Balm</a> and experience gentle support for daily mobility.</p>"
