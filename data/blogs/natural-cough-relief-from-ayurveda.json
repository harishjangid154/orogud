Ayurveda turns to herbs like tulsi and mulethi that soothe tissues, open the chest, and promote easy breathing—without suppressing natural healing.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Tulsi + Mulethi Works</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tulsi:</strong> Warming, immune-supportive, opens respiratory channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Mulethi:</strong> Cooling, demulcent, lubricates the throat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Herbal Cough Syrup Safely</h2>\n<p>Adults may take 1 tsp every 4–6 hours. Children require adjusted dosing based on age; always consult a pediatrician or practitioner.</p>\n\n<h2>Home Care Tips Alongside the Syrup</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Warm water sips throughout the day.</li>\n<li>Steam inhalation with tulsi or mint.</li>\n<li>Avoid cold or iced foods.</li>\n<li>Early bedtime and reduced screen exposure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>\n<p>If the cough lasts more than 3–5 days, worsens, or comes with fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, seek medical attention. Licorice-based products should be used carefully by those with hypertension.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Tulsi & Mulethi Cough Syrup</a> for gentle throat and chest support.</p>",
