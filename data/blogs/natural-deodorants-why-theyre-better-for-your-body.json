  "content": "<h2>Aluminium-Free & Body-Friendly</h2>\n<p>Natural deodorants do not block sweat but neutralize odor via absorbent powders and antimicrobial botanicals. Ayurveda encourages natural elimination, so deodorants that simply control smell (not sweat) are often preferred.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Ingredients to Look For</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arrowroot:</strong> Absorbs moisture gently.</li>\n<li><strong>Neem oil:</strong> Antimicrobial and soothing.</li>\n<li><strong>Essential Oils:</strong> Vetiver and lemon are cooling and Pitta-friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Transition Period</h2>\n<p>Expect 1–3 weeks for your body to adjust. During this time, odor patterns can shift as the microbiome rebalances—this is normal.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Avoid</h2>\n<p>Those with sensitive skin may react to baking soda; choose low-soda formulas or baking-soda-free alternatives.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Deodorant</a> and opt for breathable, plant-based freshness.</p>",
