  "content": "<h2>Ayurvedic Energy: Nourish, Don't Overstimulate</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda emphasizes sustainable energy—strengthening digestion, calming the mind, and nourishing tissues—rather than quick stimulants. Herbs like <strong>tulsi</strong> and warming spices gently activate digestion and support steady energy. In some classical traditions, mineral resins like <em>shilajit</em> were used as potent rasayanas; modern formulations include only pharmaceutically purified shilajit in very small, controlled amounts.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Ingredients & How They Help</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tulsi:</strong> Adaptogenic, supports respiratory health, calms stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Warming, improves circulation and digestion.</li>\n<li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Supports steady glucose metabolism and circulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Shilajit (purified):</strong> Potent rejuvenator—used sparingly and with professional guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Energy Teas Safely</h2>\n<p>One cup a day is a sensible starting point. If the product contains shilajit, follow the manufacturer’s dosing and consult a practitioner—especially for those with chronic conditions or pregnant/nursing women. Observe how your body responds and avoid stacking with other stimulants.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Be Cautious</h2>\n<p>People with Pitta imbalance (heat, irritability) should monitor for excess warmth; those with kidney stones, gout, or certain metabolic conditions should consult a doctor before using mineral-containing products.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Energy Tea</a> — adaptogenic, responsibly formulated energy for modern days.</p>",
