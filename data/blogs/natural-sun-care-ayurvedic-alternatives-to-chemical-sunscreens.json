  "content": "<h2>Why Choose Mineral Sun Protection?</h2>\n<p>Mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) create a physical barrier that reflects UV rays rather than being absorbed into the skin. For many people seeking simpler, plant-forward skincare, mineral SPF paired with nourishing oils offers protective and restorative benefits.</p>\n\n<h2>How Ayurveda Supports Sun Care</h2>\n<p>Ayurvedic ingredients like sesame oil and aloe vera cool and strengthen the skin, helping it withstand environmental stress. A light, antioxidant-rich tincture such as turmeric (used sparingly) supports cellular health without adding heat when formulated correctly.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use a Tinted Ayurvedic Sunscreen Balm</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Apply 15 minutes before stepping into sunlight.</li>\n<li>Use a generous amount and massage until evenly spread.</li>\n<li>Reapply every 2 hours or after sweating/swimming.</li>\n<li>Layer over serums but under makeup; the tint helps even tone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Dosha & Skin Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pitta:</strong> Choose cooling formulations and apply gently.</li>\n<li><strong>Vata:</strong> Use a slightly richer base to prevent dryness under sun exposure.</li>\n<li><strong>Kapha:</strong> Use lighter application, prefer outdoor shade in peak heat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Safety & Expectations</h2>\n<p>Natural sunscreens are effective when applied properly and regularly. For long, intense sun exposure (beach days, hiking), consider additional physical barriers (hat, clothing) and consult a dermatologist for high-SPF needs.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Ayurvedic Sunscreen Balm</a> — simple, nourishing sun care for daily life.</p>",
