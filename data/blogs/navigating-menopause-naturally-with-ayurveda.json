  "content": "<h2>Understanding Menopause Through Ayurveda</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda views menopause as a natural life transition influenced by Vata and Pitta. As hormones shift, the body may experience heat, dryness, mood swings, or disrupted sleep. Support focuses on cooling, grounding, and nourishing practices.</p>\n\n<h2>Helpful Herbs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shatavari:</strong> Cooling, nourishing, traditionally used for women's wellness.</li>\n<li><strong>Sage:</strong> Known for supporting temperature balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> Stabilizes mood and promotes resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Lifestyle Practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eat cooling foods—cucumber, leafy greens, coconut water.</li>\n<li>Practice restorative yoga and gentle evening walks.</li>\n<li>Avoid spicy, fried, and very hot foods that aggravate Pitta.</li>\n<li>Maintain a consistent sleep-wake rhythm.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Safety First</h2>\n<p>Herbs can support comfort but should never replace medical care. Women with hormone-sensitive conditions, or those on HRT, should consult their clinician before adding supplements.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Menopause Support</a> to complement your wellness journey safely.</p>"
