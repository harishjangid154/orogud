  "content": "<h2>Why Aromatic Inhalers Work</h2>\n<p>Inhaled volatile oils stimulate olfactory receptors and the limbic system, producing near-instant perceptions of clarity, reduced nasal stuffiness, and emotional uplift. Ayurveda has long used aromatic plants to clear the head and support pranayama.</p>\n\n<h2>Best Practices</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Use briefly—1–3 gentle inhales—rather than continuous sniffing.</li>\n<li>Avoid direct contact with skin or eyes.</li>\n<li>Store away from heat and children.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When Not to Use</h2>\n<p>Avoid if you have severe respiratory conditions, small children, or essential-oil sensitivities. For persistent sinus issues, seek medical evaluation.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Nasal Inhaler</a> for a compact, Ayurvedic-inspired breathing aid.</p>"
