  "content": "<h2>Why Omega-3s Matter</h2>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids support heart function, circulation, skin moisture, and inflammation balance. While Ayurveda doesn't classify nutrients by Western terms, it acknowledges the value of unctuous, nourishing foods for Vata and overall vitality.</p>\n\n<h2>Flaxseed Through an Ayurvedic Lens</h2>\n<p>Flaxseed (alsi) is warm, oily, and grounding. Its qualities help soothe dryness, support joint lubrication, and nourish tissues—especially in Vata-predominant individuals.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Flaxseed Oil</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add 1 tsp to smoothies.</li>\n<li>Drizzle over warm (not hot) curries or soups.</li>\n<li>Use in salad dressings with lemon and herbs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's <strong>not suitable for frying or high-heat cooking</strong> due to its delicate fatty acid structure.</p>\n\n<h2>Storage Matters</h2>\n<p>Flaxseed oil oxidizes easily. Store in a dark, cold place—preferably refrigerated. Keep bottle sealed tightly.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Be Cautious</h2>\n<p>If you're on blood thinners, pregnant, or have digestive issues, consult your doctor before using concentrated oils.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Organic Flaxseed Oil</a> and nourish Vata the plant-based way.</p>"
