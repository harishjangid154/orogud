These herbs do not promise overnight results but nurture the body gradually and sustainably.</p>\n\n<h2>The Big Three: Brahmi, Ashwagandha & Amalaki</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brahmi:</strong> Supports cognition, focus, and mental clarity.</li>\n<li><strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> Adaptogenic, reduces stress and supports strength.</li>\n<li><strong>Amalaki:</strong> Antioxidant-rich, beneficial for digestion and skin.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What to Expect</h2>\n<p>Most people notice increased steadiness, better sleep, or improved focus over weeks of consistent use. Rasayanas work slowly, not abruptly.</p>\n\n<h2>Safe Supplementation</h2>\n<p>Always follow dosage and consult your healthcare provider—especially if you have thyroid issues, are pregnant, or on medication. Rasayanas complement lifestyle changes, not replace them.</p>\n\n<h2>Lifestyle Practices That Enhance Rasayanas</h2>\n<p>A warm diet, mindful breathing, moderate exercise, and regular sleep improve results.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Rasayana Capsules</a> for daily rejuvenative support.</p>"
