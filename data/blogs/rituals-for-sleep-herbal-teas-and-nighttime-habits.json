  "content": "<h2>Why Sleep Needs Rituals</h2>\n<p>In Ayurveda, restful sleep (nidra) is one of the three pillars of health. Yet in modern life, overstimulation, late-night screens, and irregular routines disturb Vata, making it harder to fall asleep. Nighttime rituals restore rhythm and calm.</p>\n\n<h2>Herbs That Help You Rest</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chamomile:</strong> Calms the mind and softens tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Jatamansi:</strong> Classical Vata-soothing herb for the nerves.</li>\n<li><strong>Liberal Lavender:</strong> Aromatic sedative in Ayurveda and aromatherapy.</li>\n<li><strong>Cardamom:</strong> A gentle addition that relaxes the gut and mind.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Sleep Tea Effectively</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Drink a warm cup at least 30–60 minutes before bed.</li>\n<li>Dim lights and avoid screens after drinking.</li>\n<li>Combine with gentle stretching or breathing practices.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Nighttime Habits That Make a Difference</h2>\n<p>Warm showers, oiling the feet with sesame oil, journaling, or soft music help regulate Vata. Consistency is key—sleep improves when your body learns a routine.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Seek Medical Help</h2>\n<p>If insomnia persists for weeks, becomes severe, or is accompanied by anxiety, depression, or breathing issues, seek professional care. Herbal teas support—but do not replace—clinical evaluation.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Ayurvedic Sleep Tea</a> and create a relaxing bedtime ritual.</p>",
