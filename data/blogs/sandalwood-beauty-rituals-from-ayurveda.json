  "content": "<h2>Why Sandalwood Has Been a Skincare Treasure</h2>\n<p>Sandalwood (Chandana) is one of Ayurveda’s most cherished botanicals. Its cooling energy, delicate fragrance, and mild astringency make it excellent for calming redness, reducing heat-related irritation, and lending a natural glow to the complexion. Historically used in pastes and ceremonial care, sandalwood remains highly relevant for modern skin rituals—especially for Pitta and blemish-prone skin types.</p>\n\n<h2>What Makes a Good Sandalwood Mask Blend</h2>\n<p>A balanced mask combines three elements: the cooling base (sandalwood), a detoxifying partner (neem), and an absorbent vehicle (multani mitti or Fuller’s earth). This trio soothes irritation, helps control excess oil, and gently brightens the skin without overdrying.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Make & Use Your Sandalwood Mask</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mix:</strong> 1–2 tsp sandalwood mask powder + rose water to create a smooth paste.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply:</strong> Spread evenly over cleansed skin—avoid the eye area.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Leave on for 10–15 minutes for a cooling effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Rinse:</strong> Use cool water and gently pat dry; follow with a light moisturizer or facial oil.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use once or twice weekly to maintain clarity and reduce redness. For sensitive skin, shorten the leave-on time and rinse sooner.</p>\n\n<h2>Who Benefits Most</h2>\n<p>Pitta skin types, people with occasional inflammatory breakouts, and anyone exposed to sun or heat will appreciate the cooling, calming benefits of sandalwood. If you have very dry or cracked skin, combine the mask with a little honey or aloe vera to maintain hydration.</p>\n\n<h2>Precautions & Frequency</h2>\n<p>Always patch-test before first application. Avoid using on open wounds or severe eczema. If you experience irritation, stop use and consult a dermatologist. Frequency: 1–2 times weekly is generally safe; adjust based on skin response.</p>\n\n<h2>Ritualize Your Skincare</h2>\n<p>Turn your mask into a small ritual—dim lights, play soft music, breathe deeply while the paste works. Ayurveda isn’t just about ingredients; it’s also about mindful application and rest, which enhance both skin results and wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop sandalwood mask powder</a> and bring a centuries-old cooling ritual into your routine.</p>",
