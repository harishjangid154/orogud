  "content": "<h2>Why Seasonal Immunity Matters</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda teaches that transitions—summer to monsoon, monsoon to winter—are vulnerable times when doshas shift and immunity weakens. Supporting ojas (the essence of resilience) becomes essential.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Guduchi & Amla</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Guduchi:</strong> A Rasayana herb known for immune modulation and supporting long-term health.</li>\n<li><strong>Amla:</strong> One of Ayurveda’s richest antioxidant fruits, helping balance digestion and immunity.</li>\n<li><strong>Honey or Jaggery:</strong> Acts as an anupana (carrier) helping herbs assimilate better.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use Immunity Syrups</h2>\n<p>Take 1 teaspoon daily, preferably in the morning. During climate shifts or travel, daily use helps the body adapt smoothly.</p>\n\n<h2>Ayurvedic Lifestyle for Immunity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Wake up early to support Kapha lightness.</li>\n<li>Eat freshly cooked, warm meals.</li>\n<li>Practice pranayama—especially Anulom Vilom.</li>\n<li>Use ginger-tulsi tea during seasonal transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When to Seek Professional Advice</h2>\n<p>If you experience prolonged fever, fatigue, or recurrent infections, consult a practitioner for deeper guidance.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Ayurvedic Immunity Syrup</a> and stay resilient in every season.</p>"
