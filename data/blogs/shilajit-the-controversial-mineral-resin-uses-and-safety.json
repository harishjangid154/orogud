Many people report improved stamina, clarity, and recovery.</p>\n\n<h2>The Safety Debate</h2>\n<p>The biggest concern is sourcing. Only pharmaceutically purified, lab-tested shilajit should be used. Cheap, raw products carry risks of heavy metals and impurities.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Shilajit Capsules</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow labeled microdose instructions.</li>\n<li>Best taken under practitioner supervision.</li>\n<li>Monitor for any digestive or heat symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Who Should Avoid It?</h2>\n<p>Pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with kidney issues, gout, or those on heavy medications should avoid shilajit unless advised otherwise by a physician.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Purified Shilajit Capsules</a>—with safe sourcing and standardized potency.</p>"
