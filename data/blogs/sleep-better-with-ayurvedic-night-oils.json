Optional lavender adds a gentle aromatic touch.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use Herbal Sleep Oil</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Warm the oil gently.</li>\n<li>Massage onto soles of feet in circular motions.</li>\n<li>Massage scalp if you prefer deep relaxation.</li>\n<li>Put on cotton socks after foot massage if needed.</li>\n<li>Practice deep breathing for 2 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With regular use, the body learns to associate this ritual with sleep readiness.</p>\n\n<h2>Short Testimonials</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>“My sleep improved in 1 week of nightly foot massage.”</em></li>\n<li><em>“Helps me unwind from screen fatigue.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Safety Notes</h2>\n<p>Always do a patch test.
