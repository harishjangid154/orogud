  "content": "<h2>The Ayurvedic Philosophy of Snacking</h2>\n<p>Snacking is best done with awareness—foods should be light, energizing, and easy to digest. Heavy, cold, or oily snacks increase Kapha and slow digestion.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Nuts & Seeds Work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Almonds:</strong> Warm, grounding, and nourishing.</li>\n<li><strong>Pumpkin Seeds:</strong> Mineral-rich and energizing.</li>\n<li><strong>Sesame:</strong> Builds strength and supports Vata.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Mild Digestive Spices</h2>\n<p>Spices like cumin and black pepper help the body break down fats and absorb nutrients better. They also prevent post-snack heaviness.</p>\n\n<h2>Portion Control = Key</h2>\n<p>Kapha types should limit portions to a small handful. Pitta and Vata can enjoy moderately but should combine with warm drinks for better digestion.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Snacking Mix</a> and snack the Ayurvedic way.</p>"
