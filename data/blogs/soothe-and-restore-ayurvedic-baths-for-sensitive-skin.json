  "content": "<h2>The Ayurvedic Logic Behind Herbal Baths</h2>\n<p>Ayurveda suggests that warm, herbal-infused water calms aggravated doshas, especially Vata (dryness) and Pitta (heat). A bath is not just cleansing—it's medicinal when herbs are involved.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Oats, Rose & Calendula?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oats:</strong> Natural emollient that softens dry skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Rose:</strong> Cooling, soothing, and Pitta-balancing.</li>\n<li><strong>Calendula:</strong> Traditionally used for minor skin irritation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Prepare an Ayurvedic Bath</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Fill your tub with warm (not hot) water.</li>\n<li>Drop the filled muslin bath tea bag into the tub and let steep.</li>\n<li>Soak for 15–20 minutes in a calm, quiet environment.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>How Often?</h2>\n<p>1–2 times a week is ideal for sensitive skin—frequent enough for nourishment but not over-drying.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Bath Tea</a> and bring Ayurvedic calm into your self-care routine.</p>"
