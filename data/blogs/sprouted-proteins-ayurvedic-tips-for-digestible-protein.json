Ayurveda favors foods that are light and nourishing—sprouted dals fit that bill when prepared with warming spices and a little ghee.</p>\n\n<h2>Simple Ayurvedic Recipe</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Rinse 1 cup sprouted dal mix thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Sauté 1 tsp cumin and a pinch of turmeric in 1 tbsp ghee.</li>\n<li>Add dal and 3 cups water, simmer 10–15 minutes until tender.</li>\n<li>Finish with lemon, chopped cilantro, and a teaspoon of ghee.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Dosha Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vata:</strong> Use more ghee and warming spices; serve warm.</li>\n<li><strong>Pitta:</strong> Keep spices moderate; add cooling cilantro and avoid excess heat.</li>\n<li><strong>Kapha:</strong> Keep portions modest and favor lighter broths.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Storage & Use</h2>\n<p>Fresh sprouted mixes are best cooked soon after sprouting; lightly dried shelf-stable variants work for travel but rehydrate fully before cooking.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Sprouted Dal Mix</a> — a modern, digestible protein choice rooted in Ayurvedic practice.</p>",
