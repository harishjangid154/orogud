Ayurveda focuses on building ojas—the subtle essence of immunity—through mild, nourishing herbs and balanced daily routines.</p>\n\n<h2>Safe Ayurvedic Herbs for Children</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amla:</strong> A natural source of vitamin C and antioxidants.</li>\n<li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> A mild metabolic enhancer with warming qualities.</li>\n<li><strong>Honey-based carriers:</strong> Helps digestion and improves taste.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These mild herbs work together to support respiratory health, digestion, and natural immunity without overpowering children’s sensitive systems.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Use the Immunity Powder</h2>\n<p>Add a small spoonful to warm milk, porridge, ghee rice, smoothies, or water. Consistency matters—daily use builds gentle nourishment over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Kid-Friendly Recipes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add to warm milk with a pinch of turmeric.</li>\n<li>Mix into morning porridge.</li>\n<li>Blend with fruit smoothies for a vitamin-rich start.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Safety First</h2>\n<p>Always avoid raw honey for children under age one.
