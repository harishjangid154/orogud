  "content": "<h2>Why Toners Matter in an Ayurvedic Routine</h2>\n<p>Toners are not about stripping skin — they are about restoring balance after cleansing. In Ayurveda, toning supports the skin’s subtle energies and helps maintain healthy moisture and circulation. A well-chosen toner soothes, cools, and prepares skin to better receive oils and serums.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Ingredients & Their Roles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rose Hydrosol:</strong> Cooling, anti-inflammatory, and uplifting; excellent for Pitta-prone skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Triphala Infusion:</strong> Mildly astringent, antioxidant-rich, supports clarity and gentle detoxification.</li>\n<li><strong>Witch Hazel (or Glycerin Alternative):</strong> Gently tightens pores and refines texture without overdrying.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Use an Ayurvedic Toner</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>After cleansing, hold the bottle 6–8 inches from the face and mist lightly.</li>\n<li>Or apply with a cotton pad and sweep across the face.</li>\n<li>Follow immediately with a light serum or oil to lock in hydration.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Dosha Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pitta:</strong> Rose and triphala cool and calm; use chilled for extra relief.</li>\n<li><strong>Vata:</strong> Add a touch of glycerin to avoid dryness.</li>\n<li><strong>Kapha:</strong> Use sparingly and prefer room-temperature application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Patch Test & Compatibility</h2>\n<p>Always patch-test before full use. Those with rosacea or severe eczema should consult a dermatologist before introducing active botanical toners.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Herbal Face Toner</a> and make toning a gentle, balancing step in your skincare ritual.</p>"
