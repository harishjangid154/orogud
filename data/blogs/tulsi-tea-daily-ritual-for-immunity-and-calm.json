Known for its sweet, peppery aroma and adaptogenic qualities, tulsi has been celebrated in Ayurveda for supporting immunity, respiratory function, and mental clarity. Its sattvic nature helps uplift the mood, calm stress, and promote emotional balance.</p>\n\n<h2>The Three Tulsi Varieties</h2>\n<p>A premium tulsi tea often contains a blend of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rama Tulsi:</strong> Mild, soothing, sweet aroma.</li>\n<li><strong>Vana Tulsi:</strong> Fresh, uplifting, forest-like fragrance.</li>\n<li><strong>Krishna/Kasturi Tulsi:</strong> Stronger, spicier, rich in antioxidants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these varieties create a balanced, full-bodied herbal infusion ideal for year-round wellness.</p>\n\n<h2>Ayurvedic Benefits of Tulsi Tea</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Respiratory Support:</strong> Opens breathing pathways, helpful during cold seasons.</li>\n<li><strong>Immunity Boost:</strong> Antiviral and antioxidant-rich leaves support natural defense.</li>\n<li><strong>Calming Effect:</strong> Balances Vata and promotes emotional stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Digestive Ease:</strong> Helps reduce bloating and sluggishness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Brew Tulsi Tea Perfectly</h2>\n<p>Brewing tulsi tea is simple, but timing and water temperature matter:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boil fresh water and let it cool slightly (not boiling-hot).</li>\n<li>Add 1 tea bag to a cup.</li>\n<li>Steep for 5–7 minutes for full extraction.</li>\n<li>Add honey or lemon if desired.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For deeper calm, sip slowly while breathing consciously.</p>\n\n<h2>Dosha Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vata:</strong> Tulsi’s warmth and aroma help calm the mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Pitta:</strong> Best taken warm, not hot; avoid too many cups in peak summer.</li>\n<li><strong>Kapha:</strong> Excellent for clearing heaviness, mucus, and sluggishness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>A Daily Ritual for Modern Life</h2>\n<p>Tulsi tea can be enjoyed in the morning to wake up the senses, mid-day to support immunity, or in the evening to unwind. Its adaptogenic quality helps the body manage stress naturally while keeping the mind alert yet calm.</p>\n\n<h2>Eco-Friendly Packaging</h2>\n<p>Our tulsi tea bags are fully compostable, including the string and tag. The box is made from recycled, biodegradable paper—aligning your wellness ritual with earth-friendly choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Consult your doctor if pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking medication.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop organic tulsi tea</a> and begin your daily ritual of immunity and calm.</p>"
