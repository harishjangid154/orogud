When infused in sesame oil, it becomes an excellent massage tool for relieving stiffness and supporting movement.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Use Warming Oils</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On cold days or when the body feels heavy.</li>\n<li>To relieve tight or sore muscles after exertion.</li>\n<li>For Kapha imbalances like sluggish circulation or stiffness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Apply Karpooradi Thailam</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Warm the oil gently in a bowl of hot water.</li>\n<li>Massage in long strokes on limbs and circular motions around joints.</li>\n<li>Allow absorption for 15–20 minutes before a warm shower.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Important Safety Notes</h2>\n<p>Camphor is potent. Always patch-test first. Avoid use during pregnancy, on infants, or on broken skin. Sensitive individuals may feel excessive heat—discontinue if irritation occurs.</p>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop Karpooradi Thailam</a> for warming, therapeutic self-massage rituals.</p>",
