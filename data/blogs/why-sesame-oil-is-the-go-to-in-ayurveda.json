  "content": "<h2>The Ancient Power of Til Taila</h2>\n<p>Sesame oil, known as Til Taila, is one of Ayurveda’s most prized oils. Warm, grounding, and deeply nourishing, it forms the backbone of Abhyanga, Panchakarma, and many traditional therapeutic practices. Its unique ability to penetrate the skin and warm the tissues makes it ideal for Vata dominance, cold climates, and stress-heavy lifestyles.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Sesame Oil Stands Out</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deeply Warming:</strong> Supports circulation and joint comfort.</li>\n<li><strong>Vata Pacifying:</strong> Calms nervous system and dryness.</li>\n<li><strong>Nutrient Dense:</strong> Packed with antioxidants and minerals.</li>\n<li><strong>Absorbs Easily:</strong> Excellent carrier oil for herbal infusion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Do Daily Abhyanga With Sesame Oil</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Slightly warm the oil using a water bath.</li>\n<li>Start by massaging the scalp and face.</li>\n<li>Use long strokes on limbs and circular strokes on joints.</li>\n<li>Massage the abdomen clockwise.</li>\n<li>End with feet for grounding and relaxation.</li>\n<li>Leave for 15–30 minutes before a warm shower.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This ritual increases circulation, boosts immunity, and reduces stress dramatically.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal Uses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Winter:</strong> Enhances warmth and nourishment.</li>\n<li><strong>Rainy season:</strong> Prevents joint stiffness.</li>\n<li><strong>High Vata periods:</strong> Helps with anxiety, insomnia, and dryness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Using Sesame Oil Safely</h2>\n<p>For Nasya (nasal oiling), only use properly medicated oil as advised by an Ayurvedic practitioner. Plain sesame oil is not suitable for everyone or every season.</p>\n\n<h2>Buying Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose cold-pressed, organic oil.</li>\n<li>Prefer dark glass bottles to avoid oxidation.</li>\n<li>Avoid refined or perfumed oils.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href='#' style='font-weight:bold;'>Shop organic sesame oil</a> and bring Ayurvedic warmth into your daily routine.</p>"
