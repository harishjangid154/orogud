  "content": "## What Is This Sprouted Dal Mix?\nA balanced, ready-to-cook sprouted legume blend combining sprouted mung, moong, and masoor. Sprouting reduces anti-nutrients, improves digestibility, and enhances nutrient absorption compared with dry dals.\n\n## Ayurvedic Significance\nSprouted legumes are lighter on digestion and align well with classical advice to favor easily digestible proteins—particularly for Vata and Kapha balancing when prepared warm with ghee.\n\n### Key Benefits\n- Higher bioavailability of nutrients.\n- Gentle on digestion compared with unsprouted legumes.\n- Good plant-protein source for daily meals.\n\n## Ingredients\n- Sprouted mung\n- Sprouted moong\n- Sprouted masoor\n- Mild optional seasonings (cumin, turmeric) on request\n\n## Usage Instructions\n- Rinse and cook quickly (10–15 minutes) with water or light broth. Finish with a teaspoon of ghee for improved taste and assimilation.\n\n## Packaging\n- Chilled-section recommended for freshest texture; shelf-stable lightly dried option available for ambient storage.\n\n## Safety & Consultation\n- For those with advanced digestive disorders or legume intolerance, consult a practitioner. Rehydrate and cook thoroughly before consumption.\n\n## Why Choose This Mix?\nAn easy, modern pantry staple that brings Ayurvedic thinking—light, warm preparation and mindful fats—into contemporary protein choices.",
