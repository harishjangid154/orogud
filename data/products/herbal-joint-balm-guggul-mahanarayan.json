  "content": "## What Is This Herbal Joint Balm?\nA traditional Ayurvedic topical balm crafted to ease joint discomfort, stiffness, and mild inflammation. The formula combines therapeutic guggul resin extract, the renowned Mahanarayan oil blend, and a small, controlled amount of camphor for warming relief.\n\n## Ayurvedic Significance\nJoint stiffness and discomfort often arise from aggravated Vata or Kapha accumulation in the joints. Mahanarayan oil nourishes and lubricates tissues, while guggul supports normal circulation and reduces stagnation.\n\n### Key Benefits\n- Helps reduce stiffness and mild joint discomfort.\n- Warming effect improves local circulation.\n- Supports mobility and flexibility.\n\n## Ingredients\n- Guggul resin extract\n- Mahanarayan oil blend\n- Camphor (small amount)\n\n## Usage Instructions\n- Apply a thin layer to affected joints.\n- Massage gently until absorbed.\n- Use daily or as needed.\n\n## Packaging\n- Sturdy screw-top tin with heat-sensitivity warnings.\n\n## Safety & Consultation\n- Avoid broken skin and sensitive areas. Camphor may cause warmth—do a patch test. Consult a practitioner if you have chronic inflammatory conditions, severe arthritis, or are pregnant.\n\n## Why Choose This Balm?\nA safe, topical Ayurvedic formulation combining classical herbs and oils for effective, nourishing joint support."
