  "content": "## What Is 100 Washed Ghee?\n100 Washed Ghee is an ancient Ayurvedic preparation created by repeatedly washing pure clarified butter with cool, clean water. This process reduces lactose, casein proteins, and heat impurities—transforming normal ghee into a cool, soft, ultra-light cream-like superfat. In classical Ayurveda, this type of ghee is highly valued for both topical and internal use.\n\n## Ayurvedic Significance\nIn Ayurveda, washed ghee supports **snehana** (oleation), **Rasayana** (rejuvenation), and **ojas-building**. Because it becomes exceptionally smooth and cooling through washing, it is ideal for sensitive skin, dryness, inflammation, or seasonal imbalances.\n\n### Key Benefits\n- Deeply lubricates tissues and promotes ojas.\n- Nourishes skin layers and supports youthful glow.\n- Cooling effect reduces irritation and Pitta imbalance.\n- Great for Abhyanga (self-massage) and facial moisturizing.\n- Highly bioavailable for internal Rasayana use.\n- Gentle enough for all skin types.\n\n## Ingredients\n- **Grass-fed cow butter**, traditionally churned.\n- **Artisanal clarification** to convert butter into pure ghee.\n- **100-step washing** with cool, purified water.\n\n## Usage Instructions\n### Internal Use (If diet allows)\n- Take **1 tsp daily** in the morning for digestion, energy, and ojas.\n- Add to warm meals, soups, rice, or herbal blends.\n\n### External Use\n- Use as a daily **Abhyanga (self-massage) oil**.\n- Apply as a **night cream** to hydrate skin.\n- Perfect as a **lip balm, under-eye moisturizer, or soothing salve**.\n- Supports dryness, ageing, redness, and Pitta-type skin issues.\n\n## Packaging\n- Packed in a premium **glass jar** with a natural **wooden lid**.\n- Includes a **tamper-evident seal** for purity protection.\n- Designed to feel artisanal, organic, and rooted in Ayurveda.\n\n## Storage\n- Keep in a cool place, away from direct sunlight.\n- Use dry, clean spoon only.\n- Shelf life: 12 months.\n\n## Why Choose This Washed Ghee?\nOur 100-wash method enhances softness, cooling quality, and spreadability—making it a superior choice for Ayurvedic self-care rituals and daily nourishment. Hand-crafted in small batches using grass-fed butter, this ghee carries the essence of traditional healing and modern purity.",
